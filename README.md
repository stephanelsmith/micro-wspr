#  A lightweight python WSPR encoder

A python/micropython based library for encoding and modulating WSPR packets in AFSK audio.

The purpose of this library is to thread-the-needle of both enabling WSPR encoding and audio modulation from PC to microcontroller while maintaining portability and readability of python.  This library is optimized for embedded systems, especially [micropython supported targets and platforms ](https://github.com/micropython/micropython#supported-platforms--architectures) and small computers, not to mention Cpython and Pypy! 

In practice this means we:
* Avoid floating point and math libraries and dependencies in critical sections.  
	* :+1: Integer math only
	* :+1: NO external libraries (numpy/scipy/pandas).
* Special care for memory allocation
	* :+1: Pre-computing buffer/array sizes and modifying in place
	* :-1: Dynamically appending items to a list
* Single threaded, multitask friendly
	* :+1::+1: Asyncio
